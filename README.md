# GreenScale
# A GUI program for non-destructive biomass estimation of individual *Deschampsia antarctica* plants using field photographs.

GreenScale was developed to estimate the biomass of individual plants in a non-destructive way. 
The software processes field photographs of single plants, detects and counts greenish pixels corresponding to plant tissues, and uses a pre-trained regression model to estimate biomass from the pixel counts.
While current implementation focuses on the Antarctic flowering plant *Deschampsia antarctica*, the methodology can be adapted to other vegetation types by training appropriate calibration models.

## Installation
### 1. Requirements
This pipeline requires Python 3.10 or higher.
This program requires the following Python packages: numpy, Pillow (for image handling), and packaging (for version comparison). You can install them via pip if not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow packaging
# or
conda install numpy pillow packaging
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyuinHwang/greenscale.git
cd greenscale
```

Cloning the repository and setting up the pipeline takes only a few seconds on a standard system.

## Usage
### Field work (Data preparation)

1. Position the camera directly above the target plant, keeping it parallel to the ground. Take photographs from multiple angles and distances to capture the plant thoroughly.

2. To provide a scale reference, include a coin or other known-size object near the plant.

3. It is recommended to take at least 10 photographs per individual plant, capturing the plant from different angles (e.g., rotating around the plant) to account for variations in lighting and perspective.

4. Ensure that the target plant is not occluded by other objects (e.g., soil or coin), and try to avoid including unrelated greenish pixels in the photo.

*Note:* The example photograph can be found in `examples`.

### GreenScale
To launch GreenScale, you can:
- **Double-click** the `run_pipeline.py` (or executable) file depending on your operating system, or  
- **Run from the terminal/command prompt**:

``` bash
python GreenScale.py
```

This will open the GreenScale GUI. Once the GUI window appears, you can navigate through the interface using the buttons.

1. Load Image

- Click the *"Load file"* button and select a prepared photograph of the individual plant.
- Cropping window is automatically appears for selected photograph

2. Define Scale Reference

- Click the *"SelectCoin"* button.
- Click two points on opposite edges of the coin in the image to define its diameter.
- This allows GreenScale to calibrate the pixel-to-area conversion for accurate biomass estimation.

3. Crop Plant Region

- Click the *"SelectTarget"* button.
- Click two points corresponding to the top-left and bottom-right corners of the plant, ensuring the entire plant is included.
- If you make a mistake during the operation, click the *"Reload"* button to reset.
- Denoising window is automatically appears for selected region. The greenish pixels of the plant are highlighted in this window.

4. Denoise

- Mask incorrectly detected greenish pixels by dragging over them.
- Masked pixels were not counted as plant pixel

5. Biomass estimation

- Click the *"GetMass"* button for calculation
- If you make a mistake during the operation, click the *"Clear"* button to reset.
- Estimated biomass is displayed in the main window

*Repeat Step 1,2,3,4,5 for each photograph*

6. Get Statistics

- Click the *"GetAverage"* button to get average statistics
- Check the *"exclude outliers"* checkbox if you want to exclude outliers from the calculation
- Click the *"SaveSampleData"* button to save the results per individual plant in csv file (Results.sample.txt)
- Click the *"SavePhotoData"* button to save the results per individual photos in csv file (Results.photo.txt)

*Close the main window and launch GreenScale again for the next plant*
*Note:* If you have already sorted multiple photographs of each plant into separate directories (e.g. ./plant1/plant1_1stphoto.jpg, ./plant1/plant1_2ndphoto.jpg), you can use *'Load Dir'* button instead.
